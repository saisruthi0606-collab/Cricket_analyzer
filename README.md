Cricket Analytics Project

This project is a simple cricket data analysis tool built using Python. The purpose of this project is to analyze basic cricket performance metrics like runs, strike rate, and top scorer using a dataset.

As someone interested in cricket and programming, I created this project to understand how data analysis works in real-world sports scenarios. This project helped me learn how to work with datasets, perform calculations, and visualize results using Python libraries.

Features

Identify the top scoring player

Calculate average runs of all players

Calculate strike rate of individual players

Display a graph of runs scored by players

Simple and clean code structure

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas library for data analysis

Matplotlib library for visualization

How to Run the Project

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib


Run the program:

python main.py

Output

The program will display:

Top scorer

Average runs

Strike rate of selected player

Bar chart showing runs scored

Why I Built This Project

I built this project to improve my Python skills and understand how cricket data can be analyzed programmatically. It also helped me learn about file handling, object-oriented programming, and data visualization.
